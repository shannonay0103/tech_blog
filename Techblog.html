	<h2>Human Need Not Apply</h2>
	<img src="https://d1u5p3l4wpay3k.cloudfront.net/overwatch_gamepedia/thumb/7/7b/Omnic_Attack.jpg/300px-Omnic_Attack.jpg?version=46edda0e9c38dc1df5edc4b10e7d7d75">
	<p> As the years go on, creating smart robots cheaper and faster than years before. These robots can be used to do thosands of jobs previously done by humans. While these robots may lead to humans losing jobs, it also leads to people needing to have an understanding of how to use or control these robots. But the amount of people losing jobs, far outweigh those who are gaining them. Although, many are fighting against this, the amount of money being saved on not having to pay workers just proves that companies will push for mechanical workers instead of fleshy ones.

	<h3>Smile while on Snap</h3>
	<p>Even though we may think that we’re private and secured, that’s never really the case. The advanced cameras we have on our phones can help us just as much as it can hurt us.</p>
	<p>In my opinion, this is mad insane. It makes me wanna stop using every electronic I use.</p>

	<h3>Knowing where you are</h3>
	<p>Even when you believe that location is off, there are ways to track your device. This means that with our phones on us, someone can track where we are.</p>
	<p>As someone who makes sure her location is always off, this freaks me out. Bro I got mad stuff I need to hide, I can't have the FBI on my back. </p>

	<h3>Tracing paper</h3>
	<p>Even when doing things “the old fashioned way”, people are able to analyze it and figure out who printed it. Basically, thanks to modern technology, you are never 100% anonymous in your day to day life.</p>
	<p>I really hate the idea that someone who knows super cool hacks can see what I've looked at.</p>

	<h3>Interview with Mom</h3>
	 


		<p>Name: Lena Jamieson</p>
		<p>Relationship: Mother</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Shannon: How old were you when you got your first computer?</li>
	<li>Lena: I was probably like 28 or maybe a little younger.</li>
	<li>Shannon: What's your favorite piece of techology when you were growing up?</li>
	<li>Lena: I never really used technology when I was a kid.</li>
	<li>Shannon: How has technology changed over your lifetime?</li>
	<li>Lena: It's definately advanced faster than we could ever imagined.
	<li>Shannon:Have the changes you’ve seen in technology over your lifetime mostly helped or hurt society?</li>
	<li>Lena: I think it's mostly hurt us. Today people can't go five minutes without needing to check their phones or use a device.</li>
	<li>Shannon:What's your greatest fear and hope for tech?</li>
	<li>Lena: My greatest fear would probably be robots taking over. And my greatest hope would be to use technology to find cures to stuff like cancer and AIDs to stop people from suffering.</li>
	<li>Shannon:What advice would you like to share with the younger generation about technology?</li>
	<li>Lena: You don't need technology to survive. A little human interaction every now and then won't kill you. And doing stuff without the help of a device isn't as bad as it may seem to be.</li>
